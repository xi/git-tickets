Currently, the only way to see what is going on is to fetch the
"tickets" branch and read the log/diff. This has two downsides:

-	I do not receive notifications for urgent tasks.
-	tt does not scale for large projects.

A local service that fetches on intervalls and notifies me of relevant
changes might be useful.

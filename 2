Subject: Correctly handle state in git-tickets
Author: tobias.bengfort@posteo.de

There are two issues with handeling state in git-tickets:

-	There is no way to list tickets of all states.
-	The default state "open" is not applied.

Thing were easier if the script would not filter by "open" state by
default.

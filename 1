A notable github feature is still missing in git-tickets: A simple way
to reference tickets, users, and code. On github, the following
references are possible:

-	`@{user}`
-	`#{ticket}`
-	`{commit-hash}[#diff-{file-hash}[R{line}]]`

The string `fix #{ticket}` somewhere in a commit or pull-request will
automatically close that ticket on merge. Also, a ticket automatically
contains back-references to tickets or commits that reference it.

A simple way to have similar (though very limited) functionality is to
use tig as a pager. This will allow to automatically link to a commit
from a line like this:

	commit {hash}

There has been a [feature
request](https://github.com/jonas/tig/issues/299) to extend this syntax
for a long time, but nobody seems to be particularly interested.
